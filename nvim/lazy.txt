# Plugin specs

## Spec source
url = '...'  // URL
dir = '~/project/...'  // local plugin
name = 'foo' // displayed name
dev = true //

## Spec setup
init = function(pluging) ... end
  * Executed before plugin loads (before config())
  * Not lazy
config = function(plug, opts) require('lsp_signature').setup(opts) end
  * Executed after plugin loads
  * Takes plugin module and opts as input
  * Order: keys < init < config

## Spec loading
dependencies
  * Other dependencies that should be loaded when plugin loads
  * Are installed automatically with plugin
lazy = true // whether to only load a plugin when used. true is default; lazy = false to force loading on start

## Specs that influence lazy loading
keys = {} // Load when one the keymaps is pressed
  * will merge (and replace) key maps of parent
  * function() return {} end  // will replace parent key maps
  * Plugin is lazy-loaded when one of the keys is present
  * The defined keymaps are not set lazily; set keymaps in init() to make the lazy
  * mode = 'n' by default
cmd = 'SomeCommand' // Load when SomeCommand is executed
event = Event // Load on event (:h autocmd-events)
