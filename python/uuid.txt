import uuid

u = uuid.uuid1()
u.int  // to int
u.hex  // to hex string
str(t) // to string; not the same as hex!


# Differences
* uuid1: timestamp + MAC address
  - sorted since it is based on time
  - can be predicted if MAC is known
  - can reveal information about MAC
* uuid4: random
  - not sorted
  - collisions less likely than uuid1
* uuid5(namespace=uuid.NAMESPACE_URL, name='www')
  - name is unique withing namespace
  - does not change for fixed namespace and name
* uuid3
  - same as uuid5 but less secure
* uuid2
  - uncommon; not implemented
