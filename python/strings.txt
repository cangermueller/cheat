* A string s = 'Hello world' is represented as a Unicode string
* A unicode string is a sequence of Unicode code words
* Each code word (character) is identified by a unicode integer
* UTF-X is a way to encode a unicode string as a sequence of bytes
  - UTF-8 is the default


s = 'Angermüller' # unicode string with non-ascii character
s.encode('utf-8')  # encode as bytes using UTF-8 encoding
b'Angerm\xc3\xbcller'
         xxx  // 1st byte (two digit hex)
            xxx  // 1st byte (two digit hex)

Example charcters: https://home.unicode.org/
'\u0a6dXXX\xff'
 \u----             // 4 character unicode hex
          \x--      // 2 character unicode hex


ord('A') == 65 // character to unicode
chr(65) == 'A' // unicode to character
hex(255) == '0xff'  // int to hex
int('0xff', 0)  // hex string to int
char(0xff) == 'ÿ'  // hex (no quotes!) to character
chr(0x1f642) == smiley
