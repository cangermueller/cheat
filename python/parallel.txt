# Existing packages
* multiprocessing.txt
  - for multiprocessing
  - only basic/poorly documented features for multithreading
* concurrent.futures
  - Abstraction of multiprocessing
  - For multiprocessing and multithreading
  - Python3; not sure if it also works with Python2


# GIL: Global Interpreter Lock
* Avoids that Python code is interpreted in parallel by multiple threads
* Is an issue for multithreading
* Is not an issue for multitasking


# concurrent.futures
Executor // abstract class
ThreadPoolExecutor // multithreading
ProcessPoolExecutor // multiprocessing

## map
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_threads) as executor:
  executor.map(convert_fda_args,
               itertools.product(args1, [arg2]),
               chunksize=chunksize)

## submit
* return future object f
* all futures will be terminated after with
* f.result(seconds=None)
  * returns results after at most `seconds` (optional)
  * blocking

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_threads) as executor:
  for value in values:
    f = e.submit(functools.parital(fun, value=value))
