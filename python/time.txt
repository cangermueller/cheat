time.time() -> float
 * float seconds since 1970-01-01
 * precision depends on platform; microseconds (1e-6) in case of UNIX

time.time_ns() -> int
 * nano seconds since 1970-01-01
 * use instead of time.time() for higher resolution


# %time output
CPU times: user 6min 26s, sys: 1min 16s, total: 7min 43s
Wall time: 5min 2s

CPU times:
  * total = user + sys
  * user: main compute
  * sys: system call, e.g. IO
Wall time:
  * actual time elapsed
If wall time < CPU times: parallelization, e.g. total=2, wall=1.5, speedup = 1.3
user >> sys: compute bounded
sys >> user: IO bounded
